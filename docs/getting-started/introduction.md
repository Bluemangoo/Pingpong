# Introduction

Pingpong is a reverse proxy powered by [Pingora](https://github.com/cloudflare/pingora).

Pingora is a high-performance lib for reverse proxy. See it's advantages at [repo readme](https://github.com/cloudflare/pingora?tab=readme-ov-file) or [Cloudflare blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-we-built-pingora-the-proxy-that-connects-cloudflare-to-the-internet/).

It is necessary to mention that Pingora **only supports Linux and Mac**, and **Windows won't be supported**.

Since it's only a lib, so I developed Pingpong to make it usable.

For most complex configuration items, I tried to choose Nginx flavor. I hope it would be easy to migrate from Nginx to Pingpong.

Now, start your journey with Pingpong!
